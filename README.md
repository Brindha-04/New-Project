Weather Forecasting Application
This is a weather forecasting application that provides users with real-time weather information for a given location. The application uses a frontend tech stack consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface, while the backend tech stack is built using Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests. The application relies on the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data.

Frontend Tech Stack
The frontend of the application is built using the following technologies:

HTML: The standard markup language for creating the structure of the web pages.

CSS: Used to style the HTML elements and create an aesthetically pleasing user interface.

JavaScript: Provides interactivity to the application and handles user interactions. It also makes API requests to the backend server.

Backend Tech Stack
The backend of the application is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. It serves as the backend server for this application.

Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.
